Stock Market Forecasting
Overview
This project aims to forecast stock market prices using machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning models such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The goal is to develop models that can accurately predict future stock prices based on historical price data and other relevant features.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of historical stock market prices and other relevant financial indicators of AAPL. The dataset can be obtained from tiingo.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Required Python libraries:
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
Keras (with TensorFlow backend) or PyTorch
(Optional) Pandas DataReader (for fetching financial data)
(Optional) Jupyter Notebook (for exploratory data analysis and model development)

Usage
Below are the steps to be performed for stock market forecasting, along with additional instructions for each step:

1. Collect Stock Data (AAPL)
Obtain historical stock market data for the desired stock (e.g., AAPL for Apple Inc.) from a financial data provider or API.
Store the collected data in a suitable format (e.g., CSV file) for further processing.
2. Preprocess the Data (Train and Test)
Clean the collected data by handling missing values, outliers, and other inconsistencies.
Perform data preprocessing steps such as normalization or scaling to prepare the data for model training.
Split the preprocessed data into training and testing sets. Typically, around 70-80% of the data is used for training and the remaining for testing.
3. Create a Stacked LSTM Model
Build a stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model using a deep learning framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Design the architecture of the LSTM model, including the number of LSTM layers, number of units in each layer, activation functions, and any additional layers (e.g., Dense layers).
Compile the model with appropriate loss function (e.g., mean squared error) and optimizer (e.g., Adam).
4. Predict the Test Data and Plot the Output
Use the trained LSTM model to make predictions on the test data.
Reverse the scaling or normalization applied to the predictions to obtain them in the original scale of the data.
Plot the predicted stock prices against the actual stock prices to visualize the model performance.
5. Predict the Future 30 Days and Plot the Output
Extend the LSTM model to forecast future stock prices beyond the testing period.
Make predictions for the next 30 days (or any desired period) using the trained model.
Plot the predicted stock prices for the future period along with the historical data to visualize the forecasted trends.
